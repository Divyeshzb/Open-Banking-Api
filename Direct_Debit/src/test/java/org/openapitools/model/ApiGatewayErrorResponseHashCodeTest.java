ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashCode_4fca95f80d
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Null object reference (CWE-476)
Issue: Objects.hash(message) might cause NullPointerException if 'message' variable is null.
Solution: Avoid null object references by checking if an object is not null before accessing its methods.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify Correct Hash Code

Details:  
  TestName: verifyCorrectHashCode
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the hashCode method returns the correct hash code for a given message. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a specific message and keep note of the expected hash code for that message. 
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created object.
  Assert: Compare the actual hash code with the expected hash code.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method is working correctly. If the test passes, it indicates that the hashCode method is creating the correct hash code for the message, which is essential for the correct operation of hash-based collections and methods in Java. 

Scenario 2: Verify Consistency of Hash Code

Details:
  TestName: verifyHashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the hashCode method returns consistent results when called multiple times on the same object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a specific message.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created object multiple times. 
  Assert: Check that the hash code remains the same across multiple invocations.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the consistency of the hashCode method. According to the contract of the hashCode method in Java, multiple invocations of hashCode on the same object must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons is modified. This consistency is necessary for correct operation of hash-based collections.

Scenario 3: Test Hash Code with Null Message

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullMessage
  Description: This test aims to check the behavior of the hashCode method when the message is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a null message.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created object.
  Assert: Ensure that the method does not throw a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method can gracefully handle a null message. The test is significant in ensuring robustness of the code, as null inputs may occasionally be received from other parts of the application or external sources.
