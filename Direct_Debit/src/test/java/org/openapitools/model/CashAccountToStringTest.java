================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The usage of a predictable random value can lead to vulnerabilities when used in certain security critical contexts.
Solution: Use secure random number generators when dealing with security based decisions.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The public `toString` method could potentially expose sensitive data if objects of this class are output or logged.
Solution: Review the `toString` method to ensure no sensitive data is exposed and remove sensitive data from the objects.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: Public methods can be utilized in unintended ways, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.
Solution: Review the necessity of the method being public and adhere to principles of least privilege.

Vulnerability: CWE-862: Missing Authorization
Issue: There's no verification of privileges for the action made by the user, this could lead to unauthorized use of system's functionality.
Solution: Implement an Authorization mechanism where privileges of the user for making the action are verified.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test if toString method returns correct value string representation

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringMethodReturnValue
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method returns the correct string representation of the value object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a value object and assign it with any value.
  Act: Call the toString method on the value object.
  Assert: Check if the returned string equals the expected string.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies the correct execution of the toString method. It checks if the returned string from the method matches the expected string, thus ensuring proper conversion of value to string.
  This test is important to validate the correct functioning of the toString method which is used for representing the value in a string format.

Scenario 2: Test if toString method handles null value

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringMethodForNullValue
  Description: This test verifies if the toString method handles null values without throwing any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a value object and leave it null.
  Act: Call the toString method on the value object.
  Assert: Check if the returned string equals "null".
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies the correct execution of the toString method when value is null. It checks if the returned string is "null". This is important as we need to ensure the method doesn't result in a null pointer exception when dealing with null values.

Scenario 3: Test if toString method handles empty string value

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringMethodForEmptyString
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method correctly handles the empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a value object and assign an empty string to it.
  Act: Call the toString method on the value object.
  Assert: Check if the returned string equals an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies the correct execution of the toString method when value is an empty string. It checks if the returned string is an empty string, thus ensuring the value has been correctly converted to a string. This test is significant as we need to ensure the toString method works correctly for all types of values, including empty strings. 

Scenario 4: Test if toString method handles special characters in the value

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringMethodForSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method correctly handles special characters in the value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a value object and assign a string with special characters to it.
  Act: Call the toString method on the value object.
  Assert: Check if the returned string equals the input string with special characters.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies the correct execution of the toString method when value contains special characters. It checks if the returned string equals the input string, thus ensuring the value has been correctly converted to a string. This test is significant as we need to ensure the toString method works correctly for all types of values, including those with special characters.
