================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Object Equality Checking (CWE-597)
Issue: The current implementation of the equals method may lead to issues if subclasses of ApiGatewayErrorResponse are created. It checks for class equality with getClass() instead of using instanceof. This might lead to surprising results if a subclass is compared with a superclass instance.
Solution: Use instanceof for type checking in the equals method. This will consider the checks valid for instances of subclasses as well.

Vulnerability: Unsafe Reflection (CWE-470)
Issue: Although not directly in the shown code, the use of certain import statements like com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator might point towards use of reflection which if not handled properly can lead to unauthorized access or execute unintended code.
Solution: Validate all input if reflection is used, do not expose sensitive information and avoid its use if possible.

Vulnerability: Inadequate Logging (CWE-778)
Issue: Logging is an important part of tracking the execution of your application. It can be helpful for understanding the flow of data through your program. There does not appear to be any logging in your code. Without detailed logging, if your system is compromised, it may be more difficult to understand how the attackers were able to exploit the system.
Solution: Incorporate robust logging methods to track user activity specifically around accesses and mutations of data

Vulnerability: Uncontrolled format string (CWE-134)
Issue: String 'message' is being compared in Objects.equals(this.message, apiGatewayErrorResponse.message) without knowing about its content. This can potentially lead to Format String attacks.
Solution: Make sure to properly sanitize 'message' before using in the equals method. Avoid direct comparisons of user-generated strings if possible.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Object Equality with Same Reference

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameReference
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the method can accurately determine that two objects are equal if they reference the same instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two references to the same 'ApiGatewayErrorResponse' object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using one of the references as the invoking instance and the other as the parameter.
  Assert: The result should be true.
Validation: 
  This confirms that the equals method correctly identifies that two references pointing to the same object are equal. This is significant in ensuring object equality is correctly implemented.

Scenario 2: Test for Object Equality with Different Instances Having Same Data

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentInstancesSameData
  Description: The test will validate whether the method can accurately assess that two objects of 'ApiGatewayErrorResponse' are equal if they have the same 'message' attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of 'ApiGatewayErrorResponse' with the same 'message' content.
  Act: Call equals method by passing one instance as argument to equal method of another.
  Assert: Assert that returned value is true.
Validation: 
  This verifies the equals method functionality in distinguishing that two distinct 'ApiGatewayErrorResponse' objects with the same 'message' data are equal. It's vital in maintaining correct equality conditions.

Scenario 3: Test for Object Equality with Different Instances Having Different Data

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentInstancesDifferentData
  Description: The test will validate the equals method in differentiating two objects of 'ApiGatewayErrorResponse' with divergent 'message' content.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of 'ApiGatewayErrorResponse' having different 'message' content.
  Act: Use equals method on one instance passing the other as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that returned value is false.
Validation: 
  This test confirms the equals method can correctly assess that two different 'ApiGatewayErrorResponse' objects with divergent data are not equal, ensuring accurate equality checks. 

Scenario 4: Compare Object with Null

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithNull
  Description: This test aims to verify the method's behavior when a null value is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of 'ApiGatewayErrorResponse' and a null value.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the instance, passing the null value as an argument.
  Assert: The result should be false.
Validation: 
  This test checks the method's correct handling of null values, ensuring it returns false on equal comparison, preventing potential NullPointerExceptions.
